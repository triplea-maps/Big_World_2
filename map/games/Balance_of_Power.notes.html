<b>Summer, 1942. The second world war is about to enter its most critical phase. </b> <br>
<b>On the Eastern Front, in North Africa, and in the Pacific, </b> <br>
<b>the Allies desparately tried to overturn the tide of Axis advance. </b> <br>

<br>==========================================================
<br>
<br>

<br> Ability to switch on/off options such as v3 transport/sub rules, national advantages, national objectives(details below). <br>
<br>

<br> Chinese man power - China can purchase units using PU like other nations, AND obtain 1 inf per 2 territories held after combat. Inf may be placed anywhere up to 3 per territory, but all other units must be placed at a factory. This reflects China's manpower and lack of industrial resources. Chinese units may move outside its borders. <br>
<br>

<br> Tactical Bomber - This unit has 4 attack 3 defence and 4 movement. At a cost of 11, its function is precisely the name suggests, for ground support or costal assault on shipping. The bomber's attack strength is reduced to 2 and is better used for strategic bombing at a cost of 11 IPCs.<br>
<br>

<br> Strategic Bombing - SBR can now be defended by air in addition to AA gun. A one-round air combat precedes all SBR, in which fighters hit at 2 and tac bombers at 1. Surviving bombers proceed to SBR and .<br>
<br>

<br> Capital Ships Placement - Battleships and Carriers may only be placed in specific territories. This reflects that only the homeland shipyards have the capabilities of building these capital ship. SZ with a red 'X' are reminders that capital ships cannot be placed there. Capital ships can only be placed in seazones with a white dock symbol. The complete list is SZ 9 North Atlantic:SZ 10 North Sea:SZ 11 West Baltic Sea:SZ 12 East Baltic Sea:SZ 16 North Atlantic:SZ 17 English Channel:SZ 25 Adriatic Sea:SZ 24 Tyrrhenian Sea:SZ 18 West Atlantic:SZ 91 East Pacific:SZ 73 East China Sea:SZ 74 Sea of Japan:SZ 86 West Pacific. <br>
<br>

<br> Carrier-Fighter Placement - Any combination of carrier-fighter placement is allowed: Placing New Fighters on New Carriers, Placing New Fighters on Existing carriers, Landing Existing Fighters on New Carriers, Moving Existing Fighters from Factory to New Carriers<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<br><b>Strategical Hints for Beginners</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>
	<li>Axis is easier to play due to fewer logistical concerns. However, advanced Allied players can fight the Axis to a standstill in all threatres. 
	<li>Nations in increasing complexity: China, Italy, Russia, Germany, Japan, USA, Britain 
	<li>Mastery of the units is crucial. Different units are needed for different tasks. Inf(antry) are the best value unit in terms of raw power and trading. Armour give the most punch.  
		At sea subs are the most economical, but does not protect trasnports. Aircraft carriers are the most flexible and threatens the most area.  
	<li>General Strategy: Germany can single-handed defeat Russia if the Western Allies cannot adaquately support Russia or threaten Germany. The combined power of UK and US is usually not enough to conquer Germany without Russia's help. Japan needs to conquer UK colonies quickly and hold out as long as possible if US goes PAC.
	<li>Russia Strategy: Russia should immediately take back all territories adjacent to its factories. A big enough South Russia stack may facilitate the capture of Ukraine and Belarus, giving Russia +5 objective. After round 1 Russia should start producing maximum possible infantry. Use of winter could be tactical to trap a major German stack, or strategically take and hold a vital territory. Russia should obtain factory tech no later than Round 4 to reduce the effect of German rockets.
	<li>German Strategy: Inflict maximum damage on the UK fleet in Round 1. Naval strategy is not recommended, since it's an uneven trade with the British who has shipyards. Transporting units to Africa can help Italians securing Africa.  Germany should also produce maximum units possible and obtain mechanized infantry as soon as possible and outmanouvre the Russians on the Eastern Front. Head-on attack are usually not possible against advanced players. Keep fighters in Germany to defend SBR. 
	<li>UK Strategy: Early on, UK should try to limit the activities of Italian navy. India is the key to the empire, so 3 land units per turn is generally produced there. UK should seek opportunity to severely maul the Italian fleet. If USA goes pacific, UK's amphibious aims should be inflicing max damage on the defenders instead of trying to hold European territories. Marines are particularly effective at this task. 
	<li>Italians Strategy: Early on, Italians should ensure that its fleet is preserved, even at the expense of slower progress in North Africa. Should Italy lose its fleet, the best course of action is to spam infantry for "Fortress Europe" instead of trying to challenge the superior UK navy. If Italians are successful in Egypt, an factory there could help Axis defending Africa and conquering the middle east. 
	<li>Chinese Strategy: China has many options. It could get help from Russians and try to hold Manchukuo. (China can place inf anywhere!) China could get help from UK and try to hold indo-china. Holding Szechwan will give China the potential to hit 3 more territories. China should preserve its men in stacks of 20+, making it costly for the Japanese advance. China should delay the Japanese for as long as possible before slowly retreating towards central Asia. 
	<li>Japanese Strategy: For Round 1, Japan should attack SZ 88 unless there's a good reason not to, such as the destruction of the bulk of the Chinese forces. Japan should use Manchuria as a sprinboard to invade China or Russia. If USA goes PAC, an effective counter measure is building many air units and a few submarines. Japan should use the flexibility of its carriers and submarines to prevent US advance. If USA goes Europe First, Japan should build factories in Chinese mainland and force the British out of India.
	<li>USA Strategy: Two-ocean navy usually does not work. US should concentrate on 1 threatre until either Japan or Germany has permanently lost offensive power. If USA Goes Atlantic, it is recommended not to mass transport until all submarines are cleared; If USA goes Pacific, don't buy transport until Japanese fleet is about to be neutralized. In either strategy, sending bombers to SBR Germany would cause a heavy strain in German resources. Ensure that a sound convoy system is in place in the atlantic to avoid unnecessary delays in transporting troops. 
	<li>Tactics: Try to achieve national objectives, which are often coinciding with strategic areas on the map. Before attacking a territory, check to see whether the main attacking force could survive the enemy counter attack. Before making a naval landing, check if the supporting fleet will survive enemy surface, sub and aerial assault. If the enemy can recapture, sacrificing valuable units (in particular transports) for a temporary objective is highly discouraged.
